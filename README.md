Apparently supposed to teach me how to do the github thing

Honestly, I have no idea what's going on. B) I'm super sleepy and doing the practicing the Github thing which seems to be working relatively decently. I'll have to work on science fiction soon, but I want to look at Rei and Rita's work first so I can actually help.
